It is supposed to be ignored.  
But then I'm not sure what the point of it is then. 

Interested to see how spacing works compared to code. For example, this sentence is on the same line as the previous one. 
And this one just has one space and is below. 
# Default .gitignore content added by dbt Cloud# you shouldn't commit these into source control
# these are the default directory names, adjust/add to fit your needs
target/
dbt_packages/
logs/
# end dbt Cloud content
