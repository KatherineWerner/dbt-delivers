# Guide to Markdown elements 

Using markdown elements seems a lot easier than using html. I suppose we are yet to find out. 

## This heading should be smaller than the previous one

This is because two hashtags were used instead of one. 

Ulitmately, we will see the result in preview. I am keen to see how the headers and differenct spacings turn out.

And **extra keen** to see how bold turns out.  
Also, apparently, there should be two spaces when putting one line after the other. 

The paragraph above has two spaces. 
This only has one.

*This should be in italic*, **and this should be in bold**, ***and this little piggy ran allll the way home***.
